## Input 

In programming, input refers to the data or information that a program receives from the user, external systems, or other sources. Input is essential for allowing programs to interact with users and respond to their actions, as well as for processing external data . 

There are several ways input can be provided to a program : 

| Types of input | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
| User Input | This is data entered by a user via input devices such as keyboards, mice, touchscreens, or voice recognition systems. User input can include text, numbers, selections from menus, or other forms of interaction. | 
| File Input | Programs can read data from files that are stored on disk or from other external sources such as databases, web servers, or APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). This allows programs to process large datasets, configuration files, or data generated by other programs. |
| Sensor Input | In embedded systems or IoT (Internet of Things) applications, input can come from sensors, detectors, or other hardware components that capture information from the physical environment. This can include temperature sensors, motion detectors, GPS receivers, and more. | 
| Network Input | Programs can receive data over a network connection from other devices, servers, or clients. This can involve communication protocols such as HTTP, TCP/IP, UDP, or WebSocket, and can be used for tasks like web scraping, data exchange, or real-time messaging. | 

## Input in C++, Pyhton, JavaScript 

| Language | way to take input | 
| --- | --- |
| c++ | #include <iostream><br>using namespace std;<br>cin >> variable_name >> endl ; | 
| python | input( ‘prompt_message’ ) | 
| javascript | Install 3rd party module : npm i prompt-sync<br><br>const prompt = require(‘prompt-sync’) ; <br>let sc = prompt( ) ; |
