## What is data 

Data are the raw facts , unorganized facts that need to be processed. Data can be something simple & random and useless until it is organized. Data can be any form :

       Single character
       Boolean ( true or false )
       Text ( string )
       Number ( integer or float or double or complex )
       Pictures
       Sound
       Video

In a computer's storage , digital data is a sequence of bits ( binary digits ) with a value of 1 & 0. Data is processed by the cpu . In computer science, each piece of data is associated with a certain type often called data types .

## What is data types

In computer science, a data type is basically a way to categorize different kinds of data. It defines what type of information a variable can hold and the operations that can be performed on it .  It specifies the different types & sizes of data that can be used in programs. Such as numbers, strings, and booleans etc .


Data types also tell us more information about : 

> - Specifies the kind of data the variable can store. For example , an integer data type can only hold whole numbers, while a string data type can store text. 
> - Specify the  maximum and minimum range of a particular data . 
> - Control what kind of operation to be performed on a particular data of variable . 
> - Different data types take up different amounts of space in the computerâ€™s memory . 


A data type serves as a categorization of data, defining the specific type of value that can be stored in a variable or expression. 

## What is data structures

A data structure is a particular way of organizing data in a computer memory, so that it can processing, retrieving , updating and manipulate data in very efficient manner in terms of `time` & `space` complexities of different tasks.

In computer science, data strucutres are broadly divided into 2 types :--

> 1) Primitive Data Strucure 
> 2) Non-primitive Data Strucutre
