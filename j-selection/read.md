Conditional statements are used to make a decision in a program based on certain conditions. Conditional statements are used to perform different actions based on different conditions .

Very often when we write code , we want to perform different actions for different conditions & we can use conditional statements in our code to do this kind of stuff . 

Almost all programming languages , have the following conditional statements : 

| Conditional Statements | Uses |
| --- | --- |
| `if` statement | to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true. | 
| `else` statement | to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false. |
| `else if` statement | to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false. |
| `switch` statement | Allow us to execute a one block of code among many alternatives. |

It is also possible to use a if…else statement inside of another if…else statement . It is called the nested if…else statement .
