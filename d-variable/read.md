## Intro To Variable 


Variable is the name of memory location to store data, which may get modified 
throughout the program execution . 

| Language | Variable Information |
| --- | --- |
| c++ | c++ is a strongly statically typed language , which means we must have to specify the type for variable declaration , function declaration & return type and variable expressions evaluation and  there is no binding which means we canâ€™t use variables before they are declared . `int userAge;`  // declare statement  |
