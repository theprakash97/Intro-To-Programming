## Intro To Variable 
Variables are named of the memory location to store data, which may get modified 
throughout the program execution . 

| Language | Variable Information |
| --- | --- |
| c++ | c++ is a strongly statically typed language , which means we must have to specify the type for variable declaration , function declaration & return type and variable expressions evaluation and  there is no binding which means we canâ€™t use variables before they are declared . `int userAge;`  // declare statement  | 
| python | Python has no command for declaring a variable . A variable is created the moment assigned a value to it .Python is a dynamically and strongly typed programming language : dynamically : it means, there is no need to explicitly define the type of variable declaration,the interpreter automatically figure-out the type based on the assigned value of the variable at runtime strongly : strongly typed languages, the data type of variable is enforced at compile time, this means that the compiler checks the type compatibility and raises an error if there is a type mismatch . strongly typed language provides more safety and prevents common programming errors related to type casting/conversion . Syntax : variable_name  = object In python, everything is an object, when we store any information/data in a variable it becomes an object . An object is  any real-world entity that contains data along with properties and methods . In python, memory is allocated for an object not for a variable and an object is created only once in python, multiple variables can reference that object .Each object consists of 3 field : - type - value - reference_count . A variable is just a label/reference to an object .|
