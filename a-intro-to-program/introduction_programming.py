    // Introduction to programming 

    A program is writing a set of instructions/codes for a specific task to be done by computer, 
    these instructions typically written with the help of programming languages, and in programming language 
    these instructions often called statements or codes can perform a wide range of tasks from a simple calculation 
    to big data manipulation . And the programming languages are used to write  these instructions for a specific task to be done by the computer  . 
    
    Types of programming languages : 
    1) High level language 
    2) Medium level (Assembly language)
    3) Low level (Machine language)

    High level language
    ---------------------
    High level programming language is portable but requires an interpreter or compiler to convert the source code into the machine code . 

    Assembly language
    --------------------
    Assembly language, known as medium level , is not readable by humans . Assemble languages need a translator 
    (compiler / interpreter) to convert the assembler source code into machine code . 

    It is mainly used to code the microprocessors and programming devices at the hardware level . 

    Machine language
    -------------------
    Machine language is a low-level language made up of binary numbers or bits that a computer can understand . 
    It is also known as machine code or object code and is extremely tough to comprehend . 

    The only language that the computer understands is machine language . 

    In the computer , all data like : videos , programs , pictures are represented in binary . The CPU processes this machine code or binary data as input . Then, an application or operating system gets the resulting output from the CPU and displays it visually . 

    For example :  The ASCII code 01000001 represents the letter  “ A “ in machine language , yet it is shown on the screen as “ A “ . 

    program : set of instructions for computers to follow, written in any programming language. 
    programming : process of developing programs.
    programmer : person who develops the programs.
    programming language : computer language for written set instructions.
